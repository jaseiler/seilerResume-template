# seilerResume-template
Latex template for a Resume. This is a latex template I created for my own Resume. I had trouble finding templates I liked, so I hope other people can get some use out of it too!

Just download seiler-resume.cls.

in your .tex file start with \documentclass[]{seiler-resume}

compile with xelatex
